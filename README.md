# adlib replica
Reproduction AdLib Sound Card, OPL2, Circa 1990 Forked from schlae design.

For details see http://tubetime.us/?p=419.

This is a (nearly) exact clone of the 1990 version of the AdLib sound card. Updating the design slightly to be more closely
aligned to the original, and to update its support for the latest KiCad builds.
